# thirdparty-protobuf

This repo contains the build tools to build [protobuf](https://protobuf.dev).

### Building Instructions

`./gradlew build` will initiate the build for your platform. The built headers, sources, and libraries will be placed in `build/allOutputs`. Note that you **must** use a VS Developer Prompt on Windows.
